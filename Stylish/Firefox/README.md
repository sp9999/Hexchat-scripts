# Stylish scripts for Firefox
Most of these are made because I was tired of looking at dead space and useless information.
You will need to download the stylish addon for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) or [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en)
* All of these are aimed for use on a portrait/vertical oriented monitor
* These can still work for Chrome, just have to import via Firefox style.
